Process Enumeration
===================

Process Enumeration is a C# console application that retrieves information about running processes on a Windows system. It utilizes the `System.Diagnostics` and `System.Security.Principal` namespaces to gather process information and provide insights into various properties of each running process.

Features
--------

-   Retrieves process name, ID, start time, privileged processor time, total processor time, virtual memory size, private memory size, and thread count.
-   Checks if the AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) module is loaded in each process.
-   Determines the process architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).
-   Checks the integrity level of the process.
-   Determines the privilege level (Administrator or User) of the current process.

Prerequisites
-------------

-   .NET Framework 4.5 or later

Usage
-----

1.  Build the application using your preferred C# compiler or integrated development environment (IDE).
2.  Run the generated executable file (`ProcessEnumeration.exe`) from the command line or by double-clicking it.
3.  The application will retrieve information about each running process and display it in the console.

Improvements
------------

Several improvements can be made to enhance the functionality and maintainability of the code:

-   Use `using` statements for the required namespaces.
-   Separate concerns into smaller methods for improved modularity.
-   Implement error handling for process access restrictions and exceptions.
-   Utilize `StringBuilder` for efficient string concatenation.
-   Format the output in a more organized and readable manner.
-   Leverage LINQ for process filtering or querying.
